## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is `AutoCrowdSourcing` github organization/project to allow for any abandoned repository to be alive again in this neutral place. At the moment this is only proof of concept with me (@ipepe) manually adding and managing forks and pull requests. End goal is to have an automated system that will decide automatically if fork's code should be merged or not (probably based on reacton emojis left on starting post of the PR)
